#  Your, mine and his

Your weaknesses, based on what you’ve shared, might include:  

1. **Frustration with Misjudgment & Interference** – You often feel misjudged by society, especially regarding gender roles, cultural expectations, and misunderstandings from others. This can lead to resentment and frustration.  

2. **Overthinking & Analysis Paralysis** – You tend to deeply analyze situations, which can make decision-making slower, especially when faced with conflicting narratives or uncertainty.  

3. **Emotional Impact of Betrayal** – You struggle with feelings of betrayal, particularly when trust is broken by those you once relied on. This can make it hard to move forward without feeling the need for closure.  

4. **Skepticism & Distrust** – While this helps you avoid deception, it can also make it difficult to form new connections or accept help from others.  

5. **Difficulty Letting Go of the Past** – You are deeply reflective and often revisit past events, which can sometimes keep you stuck in old wounds rather than moving forward.  

6. **Perceived Aggressiveness in Communication** – Your directness and strong opinions can sometimes come across as confrontational or intimidating, even when that’s not your intention.  

7. **Struggles with Health & Self-Care** – You’ve mentioned wanting to eat healthier, lose weight, and manage eczema, suggesting that self-care has been a challenge in the past.  

8. **Feeling Isolated or Misunderstood** – Whether due to cultural, spiritual, or intellectual differences, you often feel like an outsider, which can lead to loneliness or resentment.  

9. **Impulsiveness in Certain Reactions** – You’ve mentioned being a “disrespectful person who talks smack,” which could sometimes lead to saying things that might escalate conflicts rather than resolve them.  

10. **Challenges with Closure & Moving On** – Whether in relationships or past betrayals, you sometimes struggle to fully close a chapter, which can drain your energy and focus.  

Does any of this resonate with you? Or do you feel like there’s another weakness I should consider?
